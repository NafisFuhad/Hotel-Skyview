Intro-The Hotel Skyview Management System is a web-based application developed to streamline and enhance the management of Hotel Skyview. 
This Java-based project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for hotel staff to manage various aspects of hotel operations, from room bookings to guest services. 
The system is designed to automate and optimize day-to-day tasks, resulting in improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Improvement- We wish to include a user login option as this is a basic version with only management login. Moreover, facilities for check-in and check-out will be introduced. After that, we will add transactions and monthly expenses.
